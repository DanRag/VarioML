SKOS terms for some VarioML ontology terms. Use full URI  name source and name accession pairs. Source is here always "g2p".


** Example:

  <pathogenicity term="Likely pathogenic"  uri="http://purl.org/varioml/pathogenicity/skos/1.0#p_0003">
  </pathigenicity>

or

  <pathogenicity term="Likely pathogenic"  source="g2p" accession="p_0003" >
  </pathigenicity>
