Pathogenicity of variant.

Controlled vocabulary for pathogenicity is sourced from the GEN2PHEN project. See: [VarioML - Pathogenicity](http://www.gen2phen.org/wiki/varioml-pathogenicity).

Pathogenicity has 6 possible values:

* Non-pathogenic
* Not known
* Pathogenic
* Probably not pathogenic
* Probably pathogenic
* Unclassified

*Pathogenicity* has new attributes: **phenotype**, **scope** *(individual, family, population)* and **score**.

**CMGS/VKGL suggested classification**

Via [Alamut](http://www.interactive-biosoftware.com/alamut/doc/CMGS-VKGL-Classification.html):

The [Practice guidelines for the Interpretation and Reporting of Unclassified Variants (UVs) in Clinical Molecular Genetics](http://cmgsweb.shared.hosting.zen.co.uk/BPGs/pdfs%20current%20bpgs/UV%20GUIDELINES%20ratified.pdf) suggest the following classification system:

Class 1 – Certainly not pathogenic
Class 2 – Unlikely to be pathogenic but cannot be formally proven
Class 3 – Likely to be pathogenic but cannot be formally proven
Class 4 - Certainly pathogenic

*Note [1]: implementation of fixed vocabulary for this element is still pending.* See: [lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms](http://www.gen2phen.org/wiki/lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms")

*Note [2]: The following controlled terms have been deprecated:

* Causative
* Probably causative

*Causative* was added as a workaround for cases where a mutation does not lead to a disease phenotype (e.g. eye color etc.)

*Causative* was for cases where the variant is known to have an impact on non-disease phenotypes.
