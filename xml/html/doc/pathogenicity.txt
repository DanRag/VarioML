Pathogenicity of variant.

Pathogenicity has 7 possible values:

* Non-pathogenic
* Not known
* Pathogenic
* Probably not pathogenic
* Probably pathogenic
* Causative
* Probably causative
* Unclassified

*Causative* is added as workaround for cases where mutation do not lead to a disease phenotype (e.g. eye color etc.)

*Causative* is for cases where variant is known to have impact on non disease phenotype.

*Pathogenicity* has new attributes: phenotype, scope (individual, family, population) and score.

*Note: implementation of fixed vocabulary for this element is still pending.* See: [lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms](http://www.gen2phen.org/wiki/lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms")
