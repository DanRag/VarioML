Consequences of mutation on sequence or structural levels.

* **Complex frameshift:** Frameshift involving insertions and deletions
* **Exon deletion:** Deletion encompassing a whole exon or exons, frameshift status unknown
* **Exon duplication:** Duplication of one of more exons, frameshift status unknown
* **Frameshift:** Deletion or insertion causing reading frame shift
* **In-frame deletion:** Deletion of a whole codon or codons.  Can include deletion of one or more exons
* **In-frame duplication:** A duplication that does not change the reading frame.  Can include one or more exons
* **In-frame insertion:** An insertion of a whole codon or codons.  Can include one or more exons
* **Intronic variant:** A variant in an intron which has not been shown to affect splicing
* **Missense:** Substitution resulting in a change to a different amino acid
* **Nonsense:** Substitution resulting in a change to a stop codon
* **Out of frame deletion:** Deletion of part of a codon or number of codons resulting in a frameshift.  Can include one or more exons
* **Out of frame duplication:** A duplication that changes the reading frame.  Can include one or more exons
* **Out of frame insertion:** An insertion of part of a codon or number of codons resulting in a frameshift.  Can include one or more exons
* **Silent:** A nucleotide change that does not change the amino acid
* **Splice site variant:** A mutation that affects splicing
