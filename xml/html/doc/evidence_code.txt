Evidence code is an ontology term (i.e. has optional source and accession attributes), which provides information related to the validity or the quality of observation. 

dbSNP validation should be used for mutations:

* Not validated (accession=0)
* Multiple reporting (1)
* With frequency (2)
* Both frequency (3)
* Submitter validation (4)

**Examples:**

     <evidence_code term="inferred"/> 
     
     <evidence_code term="confirmed" source="vario"/>
