Type of variation. SNP, microsatellite... Also sequence alteration terms from SO
http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_release/term/SO:0001059

Note:
This should not be mixed with classification schemes based on effects of mutations (like missense, alter splicing...) which should go into the consequence element or schemes based on type of underlying sequence (like exon, intron), which should go into seq_region element.

*Examples:*
indel (accession = 1000032)
deletion (accession = 0000159)
substitution (accession = 1000002)
inversion (accession = 1000036)
