* Branch
New version which will have support for complex locus spesific variants. Comments are welcome

Proposal is following:
<variant>
  ...
  <genotype>
      <haplotype allele='1'>
          <variant>c.12345G>T</variant>
          <variant>c.123T>C</variant>
      </haplotype>..
      ....
  <genotype>...

All leves can be named using HGVS naming standards
